// The emulated example Z80 system contains 4 pages of 32 kB:
//	32K rom and 3*32K ram. these are stored in Machine.memory[].
//
// The emulated system can page in memory in 2 banks:
//	bank 0 = 0x0000 - 0x7FFF and
//	bank 1 = 0x8000 - 0xFFFF
//
// For each bank one of the 4 possible pages can be selected for reading or writing.
//	this is configured in the out byte to address $FE:
//
#define	bank0_readpage_mask		0x03
#define	bank0_writepage_mask	0x0C
#define	bank1_readpage_mask		0x30
#define	bank1_writepage_mask	0xC0
//
// after reset the bank register is reset to 0x00 which maps rom for reading and writing in both banks.
// this has to be fixed by the system boot code immediately. ;-)
//
// Note that it is possible to map two different pages for reading and writing in a bank and
//	that it is possible to map a single page for reading and/or writing in both banks at the same time.


// MMU is selected by port address 0xFE:
#define o_addr	0x00FE
#define	o_mask	0x00FF
